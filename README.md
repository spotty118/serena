* :rocket: Serena is a powerful, fully-featured **coding agent that works directly on your codebase**.
* :wrench: Serena **integrates with existing LLMs**, providing them with essential **semantic code retrieval and editing tools!**
* :free: Serena is **free to use**. No API keys or subscriptions required!

Q: Can I have a state-of-the-art coding agent without paying (enormous) API costs 
or constantly purchasing tokens?  
A: Yes, you can!
By integrating Serena with your favourite (even free) LLM and thereby enabling it
to perform coding tasks directly on your codebase.

### Demonstration

Here is a demonstration of Serena implementing a small feature for itself (a better log GUI) with Claude Desktop.
Note how Serena's tools enable Claude to find and edit the right symbols.

### LLM Integration

Serena provides the necessary [tools](#full-list-of-tools) for coding workflows, but an LLM is required to do the actual work,
orchestrating tool use.

Serena can be integrated with an LLM in several ways:
 * by using the **model context protocol (MCP)**.  
   Serena provides an MCP server which integrates with Claude (and [soon also ChatGPT](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1904957755829481737)).
 * by using **Agno – the model-agnostic agent framework**.  
   Serena's Agno-based agent allows you to turn virtually any LLM into a coding agent, whether it's provided by Google, OpenAI or DeepSeek (with a paid API key)
   or a free model provided by Ollama, Together or Anyscale.
 * by incorporating Serena's tools into an agent framework of your choice.  
   Serena's tool implementation is decoupled from the framework-specific code and can thus easily be adapted to any agent framework.

### Programming Language Support & Semantic Analysis

Serena's semantic code analysis capabilities build on **language servers** using the widely implemented
language server protocol (LSP). The LSP provides a set of versatile code querying
and editing functionalities based on symbolic understanding of the code. 
Equipped with these capabilities, Serena discovers and edits code just like a seasoned developer 
making use of an IDE's capabilities would.
Serena can efficiently find the right context and do the right thing even in very large and
complex projects! So not only is it free and open-source, it frequently achieves better results 
than existing solutions that charge a premium.

Language servers provide support for a wide range of programming languages.
With Serena, we provide 
 * direct, out-of-the-box support for:
     * Python 
     * Java (_Note_: startup is slow, initial startup especially so)
     * TypeScript
 * indirect support (may require some code changes/manual installation) for:
     * Ruby (untested)
     * Go (untested)
     * C# (untested)
     * Rust (untested)
     
   These languages are supported by the language server library [multilspy](https://github.com/microsoft/multilspy), which Serena uses under the hood.
   But we did not explicitly test whether the support for these languages actually works.
       
Further languages can, in principle, easily be supported by providing a shallow adapter for a new language server
implementation.

Coming soon: Kotlin and Dart.

## Is It Really Free to Use?

Yes! Even the free tier of Anthropic's Claude has support for MCP Servers, so you can use Serena with Claude for free.
Presumably, the same will soon be possible with ChatGPT Desktop once support for MCP servers is added.  
Through Agno, you furthermore have the option to use Serena with a free/open-weights model.

Serena is [Oraios AI](https://oraios-ai.de/)'s contribution to the developer community.  
We use it ourselves on a regular basis.

We got tired of having to pay multiple
IDE-based subscriptions (such as Windsurf or Cursor) that forced us to keep purchasing tokens on top of the chat subscription costs we already had.
The substantial API costs incurred by tools like Claude Code, Cline, Aider and other API-based tools are similarly unattractive.
We thus built Serena with the prospect of being able to cancel most other subscriptions.

## What Can I Use Serena For?

You can use Serena for any coding tasks – analyzing, planning, editing and so on.
Serena can read, write and execute code, read logs and the terminal output. 
"Vibe coding" is possible, and if you want to almost feel like "the code no longer exists",
 you may find Serena even more adequate for vibing than an agent inside an IDE
(since you will have a separate GUI that really lets you forget).

## Quick Start

### MCP Server (Claude Desktop)

1. Install `poetry` (instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation))
2. Clone the repository to `/path/to/serena`.
3. Create a configuration file for your project, say `myproject.yml` based on the template in [myproject.demo.yml](myproject.demo.yml).
4. Configure the MCP server in your client.  
   For [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) (available for Windows and macOS), go to File / Settings / Developer / MCP Servers / Edit Config,
   which will let you open the JSON file `claude_desktop_config.json`. Add the following (with adjusted paths) to enable Serena:

   ```json
   {
       "mcpServers": {
           "serena": {
               "command": "poetry", // Ensure poetry is in your PATH
               "args": ["run", "serena-mcp-server", "/abs/path/to/myproject.yml"],
               "cwd": "/abs/path/to/serena" // Specify the working directory for poetry
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   If you are using paths containing backslashes for paths on Windows 
   (note that you can also just use forward slashes), be sure to escape them correctly (`\\`).

That's it! Save the config and then restart Claude Desktop.  

⚠️ Be sure to fully quit the Claude Desktop application, as closing Claude will just minimize it to the system tray – at least on Windows.  

After restarting, you should see Serena's tools in your chat interface (notice the small hammer icon).

ℹ️ Note that MCP servers which use stdio as a protocol are somewhat unusual as far as client/server architectures go, as the server
necessarily has to be started by the client in order for communication to take place via the server's standard input/output stream.
In other words, you do not need to start the server yourself. The client application (e.g. Claude Desktop) takes care of this and 
therefore needs to be configured with a launch command.

ℹ️ Furthermore note that Serena is always configured *for a single project*. To use it for another, you will have to
write a new configuration file, adjust the configuration to point to it and then restart the client.

For more information on MCP servers with Claude Desktop, see [the official quick start guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).

### Agno

Agno is a model-agnostic agent framework that allows you to use Serena with a large number of underlying LLMs.

While Agno is not yet entirely stable, we chose it, because it comes with its own open-source UI, 
making it easy to directly use the agent using a chat interface.  

Here's how it works (see also [Agno's documentation](https://docs.agno.com/introduction/playground)):

1. Download the agent-ui code with npx
   ```shell
   npx create-agent-ui@latest
   ```
   or, alternatively, clone it manually:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-ui.git
   cd agent-ui 
   pnpm install 
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Install serena with the optional requirements:
   ```shell
   # You can also only select agno,google or agno,anthropic instead of all-extras
   poetry install --all-extras
   ```
   
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the API keys for the provider(s) you
   intend to use.

5. Start the agno agent app with
   ```shell
   poetry run python scripts/agno_agent.py
   ```
   By default, the script uses Claude as the model, but you can choose any model
   supported by Agno (which is essentially any existing model).

5. In a new terminal, start the agno UI with
   ```shell
   cd agent-ui 
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Connect the UI to the agent you started above and start chatting. You will have
   the same tools as in the MCP server version.


Here is a short demo of Serena performing a small analysis task with the newest Gemini model:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccfcb968-277d-4ca9-af7f-b84578858c62


⚠️ IMPORTANT: In contrast to the MCP server approach, tool execution in the Agno UI does
not ask for the user's permission. The shell tool is particularly critical, as it can perform arbitrary code execution. 
While we have never encountered any issues with
this in our testing with Claude, allowing this may not be entirely safe. 
You may choose to disable certain tools for your setup in your Serena project's
configuration file (`.yml`).

## Serena's Tools and Configuration

Serena combines tools for semantic code retrieval with editing capabilities and shell execution.
Find the complete list of tools [below](#serenas-tools-and-configuration).

The use of all tools is generally recommended, as this allows Serena to provide the most value:
Only by executing shell commands (in particular, tests) can Serena identify and correct mistakes 
autonomously.

However, it should be noted that the `execute_shell_command` tool allows for arbitrary code execution. 
When using Serena as an MCP Server, clients will typically ask the user for permission 
before executing a tool, so as long as the user inspects execution parameters beforehand,
this should not be a problem.
However, if you have concerns, you can choose to disable certain commands in your project's 
.yml configuration file.
If you only want to use Serena purely for analyzing code and suggesting implementations
without modifying the codebase, you can consider disabling the editing tools in the configuration, i.e.

  * `create_text_file`
  * `insert_after_symbol`
  * `insert_at_line`
  * `insert_before_symbol`
  * `replace_symbol_body`
  * `delete_lines`.

In general, be sure to back up your work and use a version control system in order to avoid
losing any work.


## Comparison with Other Coding Agents

To our knowledge, Serena is the first fully-featured coding agent where the
entire functionality
is available through an MCP server, thus not requiring API keys or
subscriptions.

### Subscription-Based Coding Agents

The most prominent subscription-based coding agents are parts of IDEs like
Windsurf, Cursor and VSCode.
Serena's functionality is similar to Cursor's Agent, Windsurf's Cascade or
VSCode's
upcoming [agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/02/24/introducing-copilot-agent-mode).

Serena has the advantage of not requiring a subscription.
A potential disadvantage is that it 
is not directly integrated into an IDE, so the inspection of newly written code
is not as seamless.

More technical differences are:
* Serena is not bound to a specific IDE.
  Serena's MCP server can be used with any MCP client (including some IDEs), 
  and the Agno-based agent provides additional ways of applying its functionality.
* Serena is not bound to a specific large language model or API.
* Serena navigates and edits code using a language server, so it has a symbolic
  understanding of the code.
  IDE-based tools often use a RAG-based or purely text-based approach, which is often
  less powerful, especially for large codebases.
* Serena is open-source and has a small codebase, so it can be easily extended
  and modified.

### API-Based Coding Agents

An alternative to subscription-based agents are API-based agents like Claude
Code, Cline, Aider, Roo Code and others, where the usage costs map directly
to the API costs of the underlying LLM.
Some of them (like Cline) can even be included in IDEs as an extension.
They are often very powerful and their main downside are the (potentially very
high) API costs.

Serena itself can be used as an API-based agent (see the section on Agno above).
We have not yet written a CLI tool or a
dedicated IDE extension for Serena (and there is probably no need for the latter, as
Serena can already be used with any IDE that supports MCP servers).
If there is demand for a Serena as a CLI tool like Claude Code, we will
consider writing one.

The main difference between Serena and other API-based agents is that Serena can
also be used as an MCP server, thus not requiring
an API key and bypassing the API costs. This is a unique feature of Serena.

### Other MCP-Based Coding Agents

There are other MCP servers designed for coding, like [DesktopCommander](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP) and
[codemcp](https://github.com/ezyang/codemcp).
However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them provide semantic code
retrieval and editing tools; they rely purely on text-based analysis. 
It is the integration of language servers and the MCP that makes Serena unique 
and so powerful for challenging coding tasks, especially in the context of
larger codebases.

## Stability Issues in MCP Client-Server Interactions

The support for MCP Servers in Claude Desktop and the various MCP Server SDKs are relatively new developments,
and we found them to be somewhat unstable. Sometimes, Claude Desktop will crash on a tool execution (with an asyncio error or
something else of this kind). On the one hand, it can display show error messages that are no of consequence, and on the other, it can fail to
show error messages when things fail irrecoverably. 
Yet we expect these stability issues to improve over time.

The working configuration of an MCP server may vary from platform to
platform and from client to client. We recommend always using absolute paths, as relative paths may be sources of
errors. The language server is running in a separate sub-process and is called with asyncio – sometimes
Claude Desktop lets it crash. If you have Serena's log window enabled, and it disappears, you'll know what happened.

For now, you may have to restart Claude Desktop multiple times, may have to manually cleanup lingering processes,
and you may experiences freezes in conversations.
Just try again in the latter case. 
Feel free to open issues if you encounter setup problems that you cannot solve.

### Serena Logging

To help with troubleshooting, we have written a small GUI utility for logging. We recommend that you enable it
through the project configuration (`myproject.yml`) if you encounter problems. For Claude Desktop, there are also the MCP logs that can help
identify issues.

## Onboarding and Memories

By default, Serena will perform an onboarding process when 
it is started for the first time for a project. 
The goal of the process is for Serena to get familiar with the project
and to store memories, which it can then draw upon in future interactions.

Memories are files stored in `.serena/memories/` in the project directory,
which the agent can choose to read.
Feel free to read and adjust them as needed; you can also add new ones manually.
Every file in the `.serena/memories/` directory is a memory file.

We found the memories to significantly improve the user experience with Serena.
By itself, Serena is instructed to create new memories whenever appropriate.

## Recommendations on Using Serena

We will continue to collect best practices as the Serena community grows. Below a
short overview of things that we learned when using Serena internally.

Most of these recommendations are true for any coding agent, including all agents
mentioned above.

### Which Model to Choose?

To our surprise, Serena seemed to work best with the non-thinking version
of Claude 3.7 vs its thinking version (we haven't yet made extensive comparisons to Gemini).
The thinking version took longer, had more difficulties in using the tools, and often would
just write code without reading enough context.

In our initial experiments, Gemini seemed to work very well. Unfortunately, Gemini does
not support the MCP (yet?), so the only way to use it is through an API-key. On the bright side,
Gemini is comparatively cheap and can handle huge context lengths. 


### Onboarding

In the very first interaction, Serena is instructed to perform an onboarding and
write the first memory files. Sometimes (depending on the LLM), the files are not
written to disk. In that case, just ask Serena to write the memories.

In this phase Serena will usually read and write quite a lot of text and thereby fill
up the context. We recommend that you switch to another conversation 
once the onboarding is performed in order to not run out of tokens. The onboarding will 
only be performed once, unless you explicitly trigger it.

After the onboarding, we recommend that you have a quick look at the memories and,
if necessary, edit them or add additional ones.

### Before Editing Code

It is best to start a code generation task from a clean git state. Not only will
this make it easier for you to inspect the changes, but also the model itself will
have a chance of seeing what it has changed by calling `git diff` and thereby
correct itself or continue working in a followup conversation if needed.

:warning: **Important**: since Serena will write to files using the system-native line endings
and it might want to look at the git diff, it is important to
set `git config core.autocrlf` to `true` on Windows.
With `git config core.autocrlf` set to `false` on Windows, you may end up with huge diffs
only due to line endings. It is generally a good idea to enable this git setting on Windows:

```shell
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

### Potential Issues in Code Editing

In our experience, LLMs are really bad at counting, i.e. they have problems
inserting blocks of code in the right place. Most editing operations can be performed
on a symbolic level, allowing this problem is overcome. However, sometimes,
line-level insertions are useful.

Serena is instructed to double-check the line numbers and any code blocks that it will
edit, but you may find it useful to explicitly tell it how to edit code if you run into
problems.

### Running Out of Context

For long and complicated tasks, or tasks where Serena has read a lot of content, you
may come close to the limits of context tokens. In that case, it is often a good idea to continue
in a new conversation. Serena has a dedicated tool to create a summary of the current state
of the progress and all relevant info for continuing it. You can request to create this summary and
write it to a memory. Then, in a new conversation, you can just ask Serena to read the memory and
continue with the task. In our experience, this worked really well. On the up-side, since in a 
single session there is no summarization involved, Serena does not usually get lost (unlike some
other agents that summarize under the hood), and it is also instructed to occasionally check whether
it's on the right track.

Moreover, Serena is instructed to be frugal with context 
(e.g., to not read bodies of code symbols unnecessarily),
but we found that Claude is not always very good in being frugal (Gemini seemed better at it).
You can explicitly instruct it to not read the bodies if you know that it's not needed.

### Controlling Tool Execution

Claude Desktop will ask you before executing a tool. For most tools you can just safely 
click on "Allow for this Chat", especially if all your files are under
version control. One exception is the `execute_shell_command` tool - there you might want
to inspect each call individually. We recommend reviewing each call to this command and
not enabling it for the whole chat.

### Structuring Your Codebase

Serena uses the code structure for finding, reading and editing code. This means that it will
work well with well-structured code but may fail with fully unstructured one (like a God-class
with enormous, non-modular functions). Type annotations also help a lot here. The better your code,
the better Serena will work. So we generally recommend you to write well-structured, modular and
typed code - it will not only help you but also help your AI ;).

### Logging, Linting, and Testing

Serena cannot debug (no coding assistant can do this at the moment, to our knowledge). This means
that for improving the results within an _agent loop_, Serena needs to acquire information by
executing tests, running scripts, performing linting and so on. It is often very helpful to include many log
messages with explicit information and to have meaningful tests. Especially the latter often help the agent
to self-correct.

We generally recommend to start an editing task from a state where all linting checks and tests pass.

### General Advice

We found that it is often a good idea to spend some time conceptualizing and planning a task
before actually implementing it, especially for non-trivial task. This helps both in achieving
better results and in increasing the feeling of control and staying in the loop. You can
make a detailed plan in one session, where Serena may read a lot of your code to build up the context,
and then continue with the implementation in another (potentially after creating suitable memories).


## Acknowledgements

We built Serena on top of multiple existing open-source technologies, the most important ones being:

1. [multilspy](https://github.com/microsoft/multilspy).
   A beautifully designed wrapper around language servers following the LSP. It
   was not easily extendable with the symbolic
   logic that Serena required, so instead of incorporating it as dependency, we
   copied the source code
   and adapted it to our needs.
2. [Python MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
3. [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno) and
   the associated [agent-ui](https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-ui),
   which we use to allow Serena to work with any model, beyond the ones
   supporting the MCP.
4. All the language servers that we use through multilspy.

Without these projects, Serena would not have been possible (or would have been significantly more difficult to build).


## Customizing Serena

It is very easy to extend Serena's AI functionality with your own ideas. 
Just implement a new Tool by subclassing from
`serena.agent.Tool`. By default, the `SerenaAgent` will immediately have access to it.

It is also relatively straightforward to add [support for a new language](/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-supported-language). We look forward to seeing what the community will come up with! 
For details on contributing, see [here](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
